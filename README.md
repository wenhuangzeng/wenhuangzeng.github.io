# whzeng.me
This is my first personal website built from scratch using [Gatsby.js](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) and [Semantic UI React](https://react.semantic-ui.com/). The color scheme of the website was strongly inspired by a [snapshot](https://imgur.com/gallery/lMwwYIx) of a music video that I watched in November of 2018 and I have been brainstorming how to blend it into my website ever since. I have also incorporate few design details that can hopefully present me better to the viewers.


# Run & Build
```bash
npm install
gatsby develop
```
