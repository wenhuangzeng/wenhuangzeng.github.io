## Getting started

### Setting up the basic environment in Node:
You will need to install Node globally if you do not have it installed already on your local drive:
```
sudo npm install -g
```
Installing Nodemon is also highly recommended as it watches for any changes that are saved and will automatically restart your application with the updated code base.
```
npm install nodemon -g 
```
